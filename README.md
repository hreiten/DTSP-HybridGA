# A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for the Dynamic Travelling Salesman Problem
The dynamic TSP is a variation of the problem where the cities (or "depots") are constantly moving. 

This repo attempts to solve the problem by applying an improved Hybrid Genetic Algorithm, combining GA and Simulated Annealing. A genetic algorithm is hybridised with an individual learning procedure that performs a local search only when the best offspring is better than the best individual in the current population.

The python scripts found in the 'python'-folder are used for statistical analysis of the results found.
